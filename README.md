# PiClock

## Requirements
The PiClock is a weather display made with:
. A Raspberry Pi model 2 B
. Two AdaFruit 64x32 RGB displays (https://makersify.com/collections/leds/products/adafruit-64x32-rgb-led-matrix-3mm-pitch)
. One Adafruit RGB Matrix HAT + RTC (https://makersify.com/products/adafruit-rgb-matrix-hat-rtc-for-raspberry-pi-mini-kit?variant=1054962589)
. A 30A 5V power supply (Model AD0530-150W)
. A small (10mm) PIR
. A custom designed case (laser cut Perspex and 3D printed parts - files supplied)

Software Required:
. Adafruit's RGB Matrix HAT + RTC library (see https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rgb-matrix-plus-real-time-clock-hat-for-raspberry-pi)

## Why?
Having organised about 18+ Raspberry Jams in the guise of CamJam (http://camjam.me), including two PiWars (http://piwars.org), two birthday parties on behalf of the Raspberry Pi Foundation and a number of Potton Pi and Pints, and having designed and written the worksheets for the three CamJam EduKits (http://camjam.me/EduKit), I decided it was time finally get round to my own project using the Raspberry Pi.  Having about 75 of them in the house, being used for my 3D printer server, Audio Amp (IQaudIO - http://www.iqaudio.co.uk/), a Plex media server, numerous robots (inc. Diddyborg Metal Edition - https://www.piborg.org/diddyborg/metaledition), Pimoroni Picade (https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/picade), and PiTop (https://www.pi-top.com/) and the ones beloging to CamJam, I needed to build something for myself!

This clock had been in planning for about a year, but with so much going on with CamJam and the Foundation, I just did not get time to do anything.  So I decided to take a break and finish this project.  The main reason was for me to learn Python in more depth that I used for the EduKits.  And Wow, has it been a good learning experience.

## What I have Learned
This project has taught me the following Python concepts:
